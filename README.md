# Not-A-CP-Lover

Welcome to **Not-A-CP-Lover** — the humble coding playground of someone who’s still figuring out this crazy world of Competitive Programming (CP)!

---

## Why this repo?

Competitive Programming can be tough.  
From missed test cases, off-by-one errors, to endless debugging marathons — this repo is a journal of all my wins, fails, and “what was I thinking?!” moments.  

It’s for anyone who’s new, confused, or just not quite a CP wizard yet (and that’s totally okay!).

---

## What’s inside?

- Solutions to problems/Contests from sites like Codechef, Codeforces, AtCoder, and more.  
- Code snippets, hacks, and maybe some hacks that don’t work 😅   
- A reminder that struggling is part of the journey.

---

## How to use this repo?

- Browse folders by platform (`Codechef/`, `Codeforces/`, etc.)  
- Check out problem solutions and try to understand my approach  
- Feel free to learn, suggest improvements, or share your own journey!

## Disclaimer

This is a personal learning repo, so code might not always be perfect — but it’s real and honest!

## Let’s keep going!

If you’re like me — not a CP lover *yet* — welcome aboard! Let’s break some code, fix some bugs, and get better every day. 🚀

*Happy Coding!*
